        description: `This project was carried out as a collaboration for I.C.I.S. s.r.l.  The detailed modeling of a total of four substations needed to be delivered within a deadline of 20 days.
        The substations are a set of underground structures to house different services, such as machinery rooms, warehouses and other services with a total of 30,000 m2 that will form part of an 80,000 m2 cultural eco-park located in the city of Bari, region of Puglia in southeast Italy.
        With our team of architects and BIM specialized engineers, and more than 700 hours of work in Revit, we were able to carry out the complete documentation of the substations of the project. Beams, columns, foundation slabs, foundation plates and reinforced concrete partitions, reinforcement details, calculations and quantification of steel bars for construction were modeled.
        Below are some of the images of the drawings delivered, details of armor, the plan of the complex in its entirety and other details of interest.`,

        It was also considered an expansion platform for the ship and the complete calculation of a crane bridge of 20m long and 40 tons as workload.

        Potential overloads as a result of new components installations, risks due to lack of maintenance or construction errors jeopardized the stability of the structure, which is why a structural verification of the existing antennas was necessary.
        Teknik carried out the diagnosis and structural verification of more than 200 antennas: braced masts, self-supporting towers, monopoles, rooftop pedestals, among others.
        The reports submitted took into account all bending, shear, axial and torsion strains, and the effects of second and third order.
        The verifications were made under the actual regulations in Paraguay, Argentina and the USA ( NP 196; ANSI TIA 222 G; CIRSOC 306 2018-Regulation for the design of telecommunication antennas; CIRSOC 101 2005-Design loads, among others )`,

        The main objective was to define thicknesses and reinforcements of the structural elements to be used.Aspects related to the structural behavior of the manhole were analyzed, according to the geometric needs of the conduit, the soil characteristics, the depth and service conditions.
        The structural design and verification of the manhole enclosure were realized based on the characteristics of the area where the trace was located, evaluating the different functional and resistance states.Consequently, the analyzes involved the determination of the thrusts that will act on the system under permanent and variable actions that produce the stresses on the structures.`,
